# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
This project (one of my project in the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree programme) deals with data wrangling of WeRateDogs Twitter account using Python, documented in Jupyter Notebook

The dataset wrangled for this project is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter page with about 8.7million followers that regularly shares pictures of dogs along with a catchy description and often a rating typically out of 10 for the dog in the picture, sometimes exceeds 10.

This project works through the data wrangling process, focusing on the gathering, assessing, and cleaning of data. There are visualizations and observations from the analysis provided as well.
